S3 =  S imple S torage S ervice 

AWS S3 is a global service. It is not region based service.
But the Bucket is region based.

What is this service ?

Why this service is so important ? ---> 1. Cost effective 2. Flexibility

Where we use this S3 in the real time ?

Where you have used S3 in your project ?

1. Storing of the logs in different stages

 6 months ( 24/7 ) ---> A small startup company application ----> 4TB


2. To store the environmental variables of the application

	Environmental variables == Secrets or keysandvalues

3. Data transfer


	have you done Static web hosting ?
4. Static web hosting  ( severless )


In the AWS the Storage place is called as "Bucket" and it is not region based.


Objects = files 


S3 URI = s3://ram-1234567/Linux.txt

Download:
aws s3 cp FILE_PRESENT_LOCATION FILE_DESTINATION

	FILE_PRESENT_LOCATION = S3 URI


Upload a file:

aws s3 cp FILE_PRESENT_LOCATION FILE_DESTINATION

	FILE_DESTINATION = S3_URI

Upload a folder:

aws s3 cp --recursive FILE_PRESENT_LOCATION FILE_DESTINATION

S3 ( static web hosting  ) --> Cloudfront ( serverless )

difference:

1. Security.
2. Distribution network.


CDN ---> Cloudfront Distribution Network



1st - create the instance --> take a look on the values

2nd stop the instance ---> Compare the values with the above

3rd Start the instance ---> compare the values with above 2

AWS - Elastic IP

When you request AWS, the AWS present with an elastic IP address which not decided by you. It is Auto-assign by the AWS.

Elastic IP: How many times you restart the server you will be having same IP address, i.e., elastic IP address.

How to create an Elastic IP ?

How to attach and dettach an Elastic IP ?

How to release the elastic IP ?


How to recognise the IP's ?

There is a range where you can recognize the Private IP's

10.X.X.X to 10.X.X.X				X = 0 to 255  ==> 10.0.0.0 , 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2
10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255

172.Y.X.X to 172.Y.X.X				Y= 16 to 31
172.16.0.0 to 172.31.0.0

192.168.X.X to 192.168.X.X
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255


Example: 10.45.65.25 ---> Priavte IP

	172.31.56.45 ---> Private IP


	172.18.256.45 ---> Public IP

	100.56.89.54 ---> Public IP
