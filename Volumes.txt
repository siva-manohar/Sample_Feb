Volumes:

volume = storage

SSD = Solid State Drive

HDD = Hard disk Drive


While creating the server, you have created a volume that volume is considered as root volume.

Now in any volume on the cloud which range of 8GB as minimum and 16384 GB = 16TB as maximum

For one Server there will only one root/inetrnal volume and multiple external volume with the same range.


/dev/sda1 is name of the  root volume

/dev/sd[f-p] is name of the external volume ( /dev/sdf , /dev/sdg, h, j. k  l. m n o p )


How to create and attach the external volume ?

For external volumes Min: 1 GiB, Max: 16384 GiB


How to dettach and delete the volume ?


How to modify the volume ? either is internal or external ?

To modify the small or large volume, it will take mins to days totally depending on the AWS.


*** Note: When the server is in running state, you cannot dettach the root/Internal volume  

How to dettach the internal volume ?

First you have to stop the server and then only  dettach the Internal volume


Will you be able to start the server/instance without the root volume ? NOOOOOOOOOO

No, you cannot start the server without root volume. If you have the external volume stil you will not able to start the server.


Snapshots = backups

In AWS the snapshot feature is none other than backup.
